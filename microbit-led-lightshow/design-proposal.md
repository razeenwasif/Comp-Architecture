For my light show, I plan to display '2300' using the LED lights.
The orientaion of array of LEDS are perfect for me to be able to display this pattern.
To create the display, I'll load the addresses of the pins connected to the LEDS I require,
set them to turn on and store the altered address back in memory.
I'll use labels named delay (or something else) to create a delayed blinking effect so that
after each blink, the next character from the word will be displayed.
